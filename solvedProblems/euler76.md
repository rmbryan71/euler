It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

4 + 1
3 + 2
3 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?

f(x) = f(x-1) + x/2 or something.

To count to six, there are all the ways to count to five, adding one to each.
PLUS
5 + 1
4 + 2
3 + 3
