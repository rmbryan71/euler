2019-06-09 13:04 : I realized this morning that I do not know why I keep working these problems. I enjoy them, but that might not be the full truth of why I've gotten up at 4:45 every morning for the last few months to work on them. I'm open to the possibility that more than simple enjoyment might be at work here. To try to maybe get at a better understanding of why I stay at this, to savor the experience a little more, and to leave notes for myself in the future, I'm going to try keeping this little journal file off to the side while I work on p112, and maybe I'll continue this going forward if it's helpful.

2019-06-09 13:11 : I read p112 about bouncy numbers and immediately have to leave to go do chores, but I'll be thinking about this. I predict a naive, brute-force process where I make a list of numbers and whether or not they are bouncy.
