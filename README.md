These are my solutions to the project euler problems and the stories of adventure along the way.
My projecteuler.net friend key is : 1183867_IMS0sWktfxXi9wYmDmPGoLWGtiz71nXV

## Notes to Self
I did the first 56 problems in 2012-2015, before I started keeping code in Github.

## Todo
* Reorganize files for easy readability

## Process
1. Start with a text file named after the problem number. euler31.md for example.
2. Get the text of the problem from https://projecteuler.net/problem=31
3. Start solving in the text file and make code files or other files as needed.
