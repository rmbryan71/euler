# euler
These are my solutions to the project euler problems and the stories of adventure along the way.

Obviously, I'm not a golfer.
Also, I'm not a software engineer, coder, programmer, or mathematics expert.
I'm a novelist who works on these problems when my fiction writing needs time to ripen, but I want to keep my brain from calcifying.

## Note to Self
I did the first 56 problems in 2012-2015, before I started keeping code in Github.
